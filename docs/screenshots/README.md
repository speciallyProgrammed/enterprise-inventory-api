# Documentation

This folder contains supporting documentation and visual material
for the **Enterprise Inventory API** project.

It is intentionally separated from the main source code to keep
the repository clean and well-structured, following enterprise
documentation practices.

---

## 📸 Screenshots

The `screenshots/` directory includes screenshots taken from the
Swagger UI, demonstrating the full API workflow:

1. Swagger overview
2. Authentication (login) with JWT
3. JWT authorization via Swagger
4. Product listing with pagination
5. Product creation (Admin)
6. Stock update and retrieval per store

These screenshots are referenced directly in the main `README.md`
to visually explain how the API works end-to-end.

## 🎯 Purpose

The documentation in this folder is intended for:

- Technical reviewers
- Hiring teams
- Code walkthroughs
- Portfolio demonstrations

It provides a **visual and practical overview** of the API behavior
without requiring the reviewer to run the project locally.

## ℹ️ Notes

- No secrets or credentials are stored here.
- All screenshots were taken from a local Docker-based setup.
- The documentation reflects a production-style backend workflow.
